# Machine Learning Webapp Deployed Using Streamlit

A machine learning application which allows you to compare different machine learning algorithms and tune parameters with the help of an interactive GUI. This was achieved using streamlit. Streamlit is an open-source Python library that facilitates convinient building of beautiful custom web-apps for machine learning and data science.


This application lets you play around with multiple machine learning algorithms:-
1. K Nearest Neighbors
2. Support Vector Classifier 
3. Random Forest 

It provides the flexibility of changing the datasets as well:- 
1. Iris Dataset
2. Breast Cancer Dataset 
3. Wine Quality Dataset

My application also displays the datapoints plotted on a 2-D plane by decomposition using Principle Component Analysis. An additional functionality of scaling the data has been provided as well. 

## Tech Stack 
1. Stremlit 
2. sk-learn 
3. PCA 

## How to Run 

1. Clone this repository on your local machine
2. Install Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
3. Run the Streamlit app using: `streamlit run app.py`
