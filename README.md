# Machine Learning Webapp Deployed Using Streamlit

A machine learning application which lets you compare different machine learning algorithms and tune parameters with interactive GUI. This was achieved using streamlit. Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web-apps for machine learning and data science.


This application lets you play around with different machine learning algorithms:-
1. K Nearest Neighbors
2. Support Vector Classifier 
3. Random Forest 

You can also change the datasets:- 
1. Iris Dataset
2. Breast Cancer Dataset 
3. Wine Quality Dataset

I also display the datapoints plotted on a 2-D plane by decomposition using Principle Component Analysis. There is an option for scaling the data as well. 

## Tech Stack 
1. Stremlit 
2. sk-learn 
3. PCA 

## How to Run 

1. Clone this repository on your local machine
2. Install Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
3. Run the Streamlit app using: `streamlit run app.py`
